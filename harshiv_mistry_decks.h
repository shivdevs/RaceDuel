// This file contains the implementation of the Node and Deck class that is essentially the DLL of cards 
// used by the RaceDuel Game.

/*
 * This header file defines the core structure of a doubly linked list (DLL) implementation for a card deck,
 * specifically tailored for a card game. It contains two templated classes: `Node` and `Deck`.
 *
 * The `Node` class:
 * - Represents a single node in the doubly linked list, storing a data element of a generic type `T`.
 * - Contains pointers to both the previous and next nodes in the list, allowing bidirectional traversal.
 * - Provides accessor and mutator methods for the nodeâ€™s data and pointers, along with a display function.
 * - Includes a copy constructor to create a new node from an existing one.
 *
 * The `Deck` class: * - Implements the doubly linked list structure to manage a collection of `Node` objects, representing a deck of cards.
 * - Provides methods to build the deck, display all cards, and allow players to pick cards from the top or bottom of the deck.
 * - Overloads the assignment operator to handle deep copies, ensuring proper memory management.
 * - Contains recursive helper functions for operations such as removing all nodes, displaying nodes, and deep copying the deck.
 * - Uses pointers to `head` and `tail` nodes to manage the list boundaries, along with a `deck_size` variable to track the number of cards.
 *
 * Together, these classes form the foundation for managing a dynamic deck of cards with efficient insertion, deletion, and traversal,
 * supporting essential operations needed in a card game context.
